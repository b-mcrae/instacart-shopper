Instacart Shopper

A way to get an Instacart shopper all signed up!

## Getting Started

### To begin

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install dependencies.

3. Run `npm start` to start the server.

4. In your browser, navigate to localhost:3000.

### Considerations

Chose to build a simple application using Express and Angular 1. If I had more time and a scaffold on hand, I would have preferred to build a React & Rails application. I wanted to go as quickly as possible to get a basic prototype out there!
